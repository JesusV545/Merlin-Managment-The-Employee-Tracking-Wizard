# Merlins-Management-The-Employee-Tracking-Wizard

## Description
In this application, the user, or the employer, is able to view and manage their employees with a simple console that utilizes MySql!

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to implement the usage of node.js, MySql, inquirer, console.table, and javascript to create a managing app for an employer. 
In addition, the user is able to choose multiple options that execute different events such as viewing all the employees or viewing all the departments. The user is free to 
make as many changes such as adding a new employee or adding a new role. All the changes that are made are simply saved to the program's database.

## How to Use
Once the code is loaded, simply open up the intergrated terminal and install console.table, express, inquirer(v8.2.4), and mysql2 by using "npm i". This will install the necessary dependencies in order for the code to work as intended. After that, type "node server.js". Then navigate the command prompt to execute desired events.
